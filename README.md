# Desktop version for daily monitoring HP laptop price in amazon from 30 Oct 2021

# NOTE: As on Dec 20 this code won't work because amazon has changed the coding on displaying the product information particularly “price” details.

In my code, you can see that I used to track the product price using "span id" which used to fetch the product price, this way I was able to track the product price and was able to analyse the variation of specific product details. Since the change in the coding of AMZON website my program is not able to capture the “span #” hence its throwing the error.

I have gone thru lot of repositories before I went ahead to build my own, however Amazon is brilliant in their own ways to modify the code accordingly to avoid bots tracking the site details. They should also know that “coder” will eventually get thru this hurdle also and find a way to track the amazon product details again. 

I have analysed the changes made in the AMAZON website and I need to make few changes to make my code work again but this project was always about learning, so I won't dig into this price tracking of the product in amazon going forward.

Now coming to product price analysis here is my findings:

1.	In span of 3 months, I was able to see a lot of price fluctuation happening. 

2.	Whereas HP 14 series laptop was available in the market in 2016.  

3.	So only difference we can see in the laptop configuration is upgradation of RAM and Processor generations only, all the other parts would remain the same and the prices as well. Only RAM and Processor gen prices here rises leading to change in price of the product.

4.	 In 3 months, we cannot predict the products performance as I was analysing 11 gen processor HP laptop for a very less period of time. 

5.	Major take away from this project for me was, I was able to capture AMAZON specific product details, store it in a csv file and analyse the price of the product on daily basis.
